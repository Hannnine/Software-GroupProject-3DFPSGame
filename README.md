# Graphical Abstract

## 1. Flow Chart

The following flow chart illustrates the gameplay process that the player will experience. It also demonstrates the core design advantages of our game, such as **Hero & Difficulty Selection** and **Diary Events (Background Story)**.

> ðŸ’¡ If the player is only interested in action, the game can be played as a pure shooting game. However, those who are curious about the narrative and world-building can explore hidden story elements through scattered diaries. These diaries are triggered under specific conditions.
